This is a project I worked on for a heritage expert, to assess the prevalence of heritage issues in planning application objections for a site in Frome.
Currently, the code included in this repository is solely for webscraping the objections and does not have analysis functionality. Because I was working with a non technical collaborator I worked on the analysis in Google Sheets so as to be more accessible for her. 
Going forward I will be integrating NLP analysis in Python to perform more robust content analysis than I was able to preform in Sheets.
